## ðŸ§  AI Mode â€“ Minimax Algorithm

The **AI Mode** uses the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to simulate all possible moves and select the optimal one.  
This ensures the AI never loses, and either wins or draws.

Features of Minimax:
- Evaluates all future moves recursively
- Simulates both maximizing (AI) and minimizing (player) strategies
- Guarantees an unbeatable experience

## ðŸŽ² Random Mode

The **Random Mode** selects a move randomly from available cells.  
This mode is great for casual and unpredictable games.
